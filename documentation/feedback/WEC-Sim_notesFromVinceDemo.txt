These are notes from a short demo given to Vince on how to use WEC-Sim.

	The functions and pre-processing: does it still make sense to separate them 
	the way they are? The ‘functions’ folder contains both functions and 
	scripts. That might be semantics but apparently it can be misleading. Should
	we leave these folders as they are, or should we combine them, or rename 
	them something else?
	
	I think either the simu or waves class should have the time vector. When 
	trying to plot the wave amplitude time history this is how I had to do it: 
	plot(output.bodies(1).time, waves.waveAmpTime). It is a bit awkward to have 
	to get the time from the body response. Thoughts?
	
	We should have an example of how to setup an irregular wave case. Kelley is 
	going to add some commented-out lines in the RM3 input file, and mention it 
	briefly in the manual.
	
	The naming convention for files (functions, etc.) is not consistent (use of 
	capital and lower case letters).
	
	Jonswap gama is hardcoded to 3.3
	
	An obvious next step after running the simulation is plotting results. It  
	might be nice to include sample post-processing scripts? I have a couple of 
	generalized post-processing scripts for plotting forces and response if 
	anyone wants to look at it.
	
	It is very difficult to follow the code sometimes. Example: to understand 
	how waves are setup you need to look at the wave class, several 
	pre-processing functions, and the Body block in the right order.
