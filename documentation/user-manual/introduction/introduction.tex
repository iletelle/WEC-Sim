\chapter{Introduction}
WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) is an open source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB and Simulink using the multibody dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off (PTO) systems, and mooring systems. Hydrodynamic forces are modeled using a radiation and diffarction method, and the system dynamics is performed in the time domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF).

In this user manual, the theory of WEC-Sim is described in \hyperlink{chapter.2}{Chapter 2}. The installation of MATLAB and WEC-Sim and how to run WEC-Sim is described in \hyperlink{chapter.3}{Chapter 3}. The pre-developed WEC component library structure is presented in \hyperlink{chapter.4}{Chapter 4}. The code WEC-Sim structure and the input parameters for running WEC-Sim are described in \hyperlink{chapter.5}{Chapter 5}. Finally, the application of WEC-Sim to model a point absorber and a oscillating surge device is presented in \hyperlink{chapter.6}{Chapter 6}.
